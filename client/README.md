# React + Vite

Recipes is small project for creating recipes.

To run the project you need to start the server /server with "node server.js",
To run the react you need to be in folder /client and run commnad "npm run dev"



This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.



Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
